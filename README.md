## Problem Statement

Despite India's 2018–19 claim of 100% village electrification, millions in rural and remote areas still face severe and unpredictable electricity outages. In many regions, the power situation remains unstable, opaque, and unequal, with issues extending beyond infrastructure to include corruption and lack of accountability.

### Key Issues

- **Frequent and Long Outages:**  
  Rural households often experience 8–18 hours of daily power cuts, sometimes lasting for days.

- **False or Ignored Complaints:**  
  Some electricity complaints are marked as resolved without any actual repairs being made.

- **Corruption and Delay:**  
  Reports indicate that bribes influence repair priority, while other areas face long delays before issues are addressed.

- **Slow and Reactive Dashboards:**  
  Government monitoring systems are often manual, slow, and reactive, providing limited real-time visibility.

- **Lack of Citizen Voice:**  
  Complaints from citizens, especially those in rural and remote regions, are often not taken seriously or acted upon in time.

### Ground Reality

- **Assam and Manipur:** Long delays persist in connecting “electrified” villages to consistent power supply.  
- **Rajasthan (2024, Orange Tree Foundation):** Rural households endure an average of 12 hours of power cuts daily.  
  - 60% of rural complaints take over 6 hours to resolve compared to just 13% in urban areas.  
- **Delhi:** Over 51,958 outages exceeding 5 hours occurred over the last decade, averaging 14 per day.  
- **Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Assam:** Many regions experience 6–12 hours of power cuts daily.  
- **NITI Aayog & CEEW (2021):** Only 47% of households receive more than 12 hours of power per day.

### Why This Matters

Reliable electricity is essential for education, healthcare, agriculture, and livelihoods. Without transparent tracking and citizen participation, power inequality and administrative negligence persist, leaving rural communities at a significant disadvantage.

PowerChain addresses these challenges by creating a decentralized, transparent, and real-time power outage tracking system. It enables both citizens and authorities to verify power availability, monitor complaints, and ensure accountability across regions.
